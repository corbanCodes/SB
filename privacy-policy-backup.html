                            <strong>NOTICE:</strong> We have updated our Privacy Policy effective January 1st, 2024. We did this primarily (1) to notify Users about our COPPA, FERPA, and California Student Privacy; (2) to create more consistency in how we explain our student data practices across this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, and our Client Agreements; and (3) to add language about new laws that may apply to you. We believe the rights and obligations of Users and SchoolBlocks did not materially change as a result of this update. However, we encourage you to review the updated Privacy Policy below, which applies to all Users of the Services on a going-forward basis.
